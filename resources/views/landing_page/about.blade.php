                       <p class="section-description">Julia B. is very sensitive to subtle energies of objects, animals and people. She consumes energy doing this evaluation. She can evaluate a maximum of 100 automobiles a day. And for now, she will check up to 3 cars per person free of charge (and no more). Please note that this is for your personal use, and there are no guarantees that the car she approves, will be completely trouble free. But she has a proven track record of being %95 accurate in her evaluation..</p>

Even the best mechanics with the latest technologies who can check  a used car and give you a report of list of possible repairs can not detect the parts that are working at the moment of examination, but are done, used up and ready and about to break at any moment.</p >
