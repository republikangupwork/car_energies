                       <p class="section-description" >Julia is very sensitive to subtle energies of objects, animals and people. She senses the defective or broken parts too. She has helped people to choose best used vehicle and stay away from buying lemons.</p>
                        <p class="section-description">She has helped her friends and clients choose homes, lands, appliances, vehicles and other objects. She can help you too.  For now, she will analyze up to 3 cars per person free of charge</p>
                        <p class="section-description">Please note that this service is for your personal use, and there are no guarantees that the car she approves, will be completely trouble free or the parts that she reports to be faulty or braking soon actually are. But she has a proven track record of being %95 accurate in her evaluation</p>
